1. e4 e5 2. Nc3 Bc5 3. Na4 $6 {Is this good  $2 No. But if it weren't for Black's
response, it would not be so bad to chase the bishop and try to bring the knight
back later. See Nadanian's Na4 in the Gruenfeld for another example.} 3...
Bxf2+ $3 {Boom  $1 Black spots the flaw in White's tempo-losing knight hop to the
rim and initiates an incredible attack though White also has some exciting
opportunities.} 4. Kxf2 Qh4+ 5. Ke3 (5. g3 $1 Qxe4 {attacks both the knight on a4
and rook on h1. One would think that this just loses for White, but actually
White can now sacrifice the rook for massive compensation.} 6. Qe2 Qxh1 (6...
Qxa4 7. Qxe5+ Ne7 8. Qxg7 $14) 7. Qxe5+ Kf8 8. Qxc7 $13) 5... Qf4+ 6. Kd3 d5
{White's king is sweating buckets here.} 7. Kc3 $6 (7. exd5 $4 Qxa4 $19) (7. Qe1 $1
Nf6 $15 {Black's attack provides more than enough compensation, but the battle
continues.} (7... dxe4+ $2 8. Kc3 $16 {Black has won a pawn, but the doubled pawns
stop the queen from attacking the white king.} (8. Qxe4 $4 Bf5 $19))) 7... Qxe4 $2
(7... d4+ $1 8. Kd3 (8. Kb3 Qxe4 $17 {is White's best try, but he has lost e4 for
naught.}) 8... f5 $19 {is likely to win.}) 8. Kb3 $2 {White's king is trying to
flee as fast as possible, but he is neglecting chances to develop other pieces.}
(8. d4 $1 {Striking in the middle to develop the pieces and defend the king with
their might was by far the best.} 8... exd4+ 9. Qxd4 Qe1+ 10. Bd2 $3 {The rook
sacrifices leads to a crushing attack. White's king is uncastled on c3, but it
is the black king in mortal danger.} 10... Qxa1 11. Nf3 $18 {White threatens Qxg7
and Bb5+, and Black is lacking a good response.}) 8... Na6 $2 {The knight supports
the mate threat ...Qb4, but the more conventional central development was
better.} (8... Nc6 $17) (8... d4 $17) 9. a3 $5 {intending simply Nc3 and Ka2, and
White is just winning  $1} (9. d4 $1 {Splitting the board and cutting off the queen
on e4 and freeing the bishop d2 before trying to play a3 and tuck in the king on
a2 is a really effective solution.} 9... exd4 10. a3 $1 $18 {after Ka2, the white
king will be safe and Black lacks counterplay.}) 9... Qxa4+ $3 {AMAZING  $1
Technically, this loses in one and only one complex variation, but White's path
is very difficult, and the white king is very close to being checkmated. With
one misstep, it will be checkmated.} 10. Kxa4 (10. Ka2 $19 {Black just be up two
pawns with a huge center, safer king, etc.}) 10... Nc5+ 11. Kb4 $2 {White allows
...a5+  $1 with tempo, and Black's mating net is so powerful that White is the one
who will need to be brilliant to hold a draw by perpetual.} (11. Kb5 $1 {Only this
move wins.} 11... Ne7 $5 {This is Black's most dangerous try. White must find
12.c4  $1, and Black will still have some play.} (11... b6 {...Bd7 ...a5 and
...d4# is a potent idea, but White has one winning defense involving returning
the queen.} 12. d4 $1 exd4 13. Qxd4 Ne7 14. Qxc5 $1 $18 {And with the return of the
queen and the elimination of the c5-knight, White is just up a piece and
completely safe.}) (11... a5 12. b4 $1 $18 {Breaks up the attack, and White should
win.} (12. Kxc5 $2 Ne7 {threatens ...b6+ and ...Bd7#, but...} 13. Bb5+ Kd8 14.
Bc6 $3 {Only this idea which also appears in the game is enough to save the game
and even win for White. The difference in the game is that Black will get to
play ...a5+ with tempo.} 14... b6+ 15. Kb5 Nxc6 16. Kxc6 Bb7+ $12 {is the game
line.})) 12. c4 $1 {This seems to be White's one narrow path to a likely winning
position.} (12. Kxc5 $2 a5 13. Bb5+ Kd8 14. Bc6 $3 b6+ 15. Kb5 Nxc6 16. Kxc6 Bb7+ $12
{is the game line.}) 12... d4 13. Kxc5 a5 14. Qa4+ Kd8 15. Qxa5 Rxa5+ 16. Kb4
Nc6+ 17. Kb3 e4) (11. Ka5 $4 b6+ 12. Kb5 Ne7 {is simply mating with the idea of
...Ba6+ Kb4 Nc6+ Kc3 and d4 mates.}) 11... a5+ $3 {The knight is sacrified, but
Black takes control of the dark squares with the pawns, and will attempt to
checkmate on the light squares with the bishop.} 12. Kxc5 (12. Kc3 $6 d4+ 13. Kc4
b6 $17 {White will need to return the queen (e.g. Qf3 Be6+ Qd5 to survive.}) 12...
Ne7 $1 {The simple threat is ...b6+ and ...Bd7 checkmate. How can White survive  $2}
13. Bb5+ Kd8 14. Bc6 $3 {This is the way  $1 White gets his first chance to display
his own brilliance and proves up to the task. This move disrupts Black's
coordination, providing cover for the white king to escape on the light squares,
and now the onus is again on Black to be brilliant to keep the attack going.}
14... b6+ 15. Kb5 Nxc6 {intending ...Nd4+ (even if a sacrifice) and ...Bd7#.
This would just force checkmate so the knight must be captured.} 16. Kxc6 Bb7+ $3
{Amazing  $1 Black ones again finds an essential and spectacular idea. The bishop
cannot be captured due to checkmate so White must flee. Black though is down so
much material that the White king must stay in check or White will consolidate
and win. Thus, the result is a draw.} 17. Kb5 (17. Kxb7 $4 Kd7 18. Qg4+ {It's
kind of amazing that Black can allow the queen to activate like this with check,
and it doesn't help White at all.} 18... Kd6 {and ...Rhb8 will be mate.}) 17...
Ba6+ 18. Kc6 (18. Ka4 $4 Bc4 $1 {...b5 is checkmate on the next move.}) 18... Bb7+
{I hope you will agree, this spectacular game deserves to be called the Immortal
Draw.} 1/2-1/2
